# 🎨 Marlou Reyes – Portfolio Website

Hi, I’m **Marlou Reyes** 👋  
Welcome to my single-page digital portfolio — a clean, modern, and scroll-friendly space that tells you who I am, what I do, and why I love building things on the web.

> Built with purpose, styled with intention, and deployed with care.

## ✨ What’s Inside?

This isn’t your average multi-tab, maze-like website.  
It’s **one page** — simple, intentional, scrollable, and fast.

You’ll glide through:

- 🙋‍♂️ **About Me** – A quick snapshot of who I am
- 🧠 **Skills & Tools** – My tech playground
- 📂 **Projects** – My proudest builds and creative messes
- 💌 **Contact** – Don’t be shy, let’s connect

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

This site runs on clean components and caffeine-fueled late nights, using:

- ⚛️ **Next.js** – React + performance = 💙
- 🧩 **shadcn/ui** – For beautiful, accessible components
- 🎨 **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first styling that doesn’t get in the way
- 📦 **TypeScript** – Because type safety is sexy
- 🚀 **Vercel** – For blazing fast deployment and smooth developer experience
